Memes as a Service

Exclusively for Linux

Send dank memes via MMS to +1-708-550-4050. memecdn.net will store all the memes and you can you changeWallpaper.sh in combination with crontab to set your desktop to the latest and the greatest submissions by fellow memers. Place the shell file on your home directory. Your desktop may change as frequently as 1 minute and I am not responsible for the contents you see on your desktop. I will, however, moderate greatly offensive memes.
